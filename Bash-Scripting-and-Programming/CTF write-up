Linux Scavenger Hunt CTF Write-up
Introduction
This write-up details the approach taken to solve the Linux Scavenger Hunt CTF. The challenge involved launching a headless virtual machine server and finding eight flags hidden within the system.

Challenge Description
The challenge was to find eight flags hidden within a Linux virtual machine. The flags were hidden in various locations and required different techniques to find. Some flags were hidden in files, others required cracking passwords, and one required exploiting a vulnerability to gain root access.

Initial Analysis
Upon logging into the system, I started by exploring the file system and looking for anything unusual. I also checked the list of users on the system and their associated files.

Approach and Tools Used
The primary tools used were basic Linux commands such as ls, cat, grep, and find. For password cracking, I used john the ripper. To gain root access, I used a privilege escalation exploit.

Solution
Flag 1
I found the first flag in a file located in the /etc directory. The file contained old passwords for users.

Flag 2
The second flag was found by cracking the password of a user named 'hacker'. I used john the ripper to crack the password and logged into the account.

Flag 3
The third flag was found in a log file related to the 'hacker' user. I used the uniq command to find the unique count of IP addresses in the log file. This number was used as a password to unzip a file related to the 'hacker' user.

Flag 4
The fourth flag was found in a directory containing a list of hackers. The flag was in a file that had read permissions for the owner, no permissions for the group, and was executable for everyone else.

Flag 5
The fifth flag was found by debugging and running a bash script written by one of the users.

Flag 6
The sixth flag was found by inspecting a user's custom aliases and running a suspicious one.

Flag 7
The seventh flag was found by exploiting a vulnerability to gain a root shell. I logged in as the root user and found the flag.

Flag 8
The final flag was found by gathering the seven flags into a file and formatting them as if each flag was a username and password. I cracked these passwords to find the final flag.

Conclusion
This CTF was a great exercise in Linux commands, password cracking, and privilege escalation. It was a fun and challenging way to apply these skills in a realistic scenario.
