# Module 4 Homework Assignment: Linux System Administration
## Overview
In this homework assignment, we acted as a system administrator to troubleshoot a malfunctioning Linux server. The senior administrator was pleased with our work and has now tasked us with preparing another server to replace the malfunctioning one. The steps involved in this process include ensuring permissions on sensitive files, creating user accounts, creating a user group and collaborative folder, and running system and security auditing tools to harden the system.
